I'll provide a comprehensive overview of the project.

Project Setup
Built with Vite + React + TypeScript
Tailwind CSS for styling
Vitest + React Testing Library for testing
ESLint for code quality
Component Architecture
The application follows a modular component structure:


src/
├── components/
│   ├── Navigation.tsx    # Main navigation bar
│   ├── Hero.tsx         # Hero section with main message
│   ├── Slides.tsx       # Interactive slide presentation
│   ├── ContactForm.tsx  # Contact form component
│   └── Footer.tsx       # Site footer
├── context/
│   └── AppContext.tsx   # Global state management
└── tests/
    └── __tests__/       # Component tests
Key architectural decisions:

Context API for state management
Reusable components with clear responsibilities
Separation of concerns between UI and logic
Responsive Design Strategy
Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS
Breakpoint system:
Mobile: < 768px
Tablet: 768px - 1024px
Desktop: > 1024px
Flexible grid layouts
Responsive typography using relative units
Hamburger menu for mobile navigation
